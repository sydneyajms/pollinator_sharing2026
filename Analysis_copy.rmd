Begin whole network Analysis

```{r}

# visualise network as heatmap
library(RColorBrewer)
cols <- hcl.colors(20, "Peach", rev = TRUE)
#par(mfrow =c(2,3))
lapply(clist, visweb, square = "defined", box.col = "black", def.col = cols, labsize = 0.5, text = "interaction", textcol = "black", NA.col = "white")

# make overlap models
lapply(clist, plotweb)
```

Seed analysis and joining 

```{r}
# find average Open - Closed per plant per group 
zeros <- seeds[,c('OsPerb','CsPerb')]==0 
seeds[,c('OsPerb','CsPerb')][zeros] <- NA 

# find means, differences and ratios of pollinator impact 
seedsGrouped <- seeds %>%
  mutate(diff_poll_impact = OsPerb -CsPerb) %>%
  mutate(ratio_poll_impact = OsPerb/CsPerb) %>%
  group_by(genSpec, sp) %>%
  mutate(diff_seedsPerPlant = mean(diff_poll_impact, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(ratio_seedsPerPlant = mean(ratio_poll_impact, na.rm = TRUE))

#remove unneccesary collumns 
smallSeeds <- seedsGrouped %>% 
  distinct(genSpec, sp, ratio_seedsPerPlant)

# split into communities
focalSeeds <- smallSeeds %>% 
  rename(treatment = "genSpec") %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = treatment, names_from = sp, values_from = ratio_seedsPerPlant) %>%
  inner_join(diffNichedf, by = "treatment", relationship = "many-to-many") %>%
  subset(select = -c(overlap, overlapNet))

splitdf <- split(focalSeeds, focalSeeds$treatment)
```

seed ploting drafts

```{r}
# plot overlap against seed ratios 
plots <- vector("list", length(splitdf))
for(i in seq_along(splitdf)){
  this_treat <- splitdf[[i]]
  plots[[i]] <-ggplot(this_treat, aes(x = overlap, y = value, color = group)) + geom_point(size = 3) + theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = names(splitdf)[i], x = "Overlap difference", y = "Ratio of Seeds As a Result of Pollination")}

plots[1]
```

Hypothesis 1 = visitation against pollinatopr overlap and seed output 

```{r}
# subset overlap to pollinatoprs 
NicheHypOne <- diffNichedf %>%
  filter(group == "pollinators") %>%
  subset(select = c(treatment, diff, partner_diversity))

# join overlap to visitation 
HypothOne <- visitation %>%
  inner_join(NicheHypOne) %>%
  inner_join(richness)

ggplot(HypothOne, aes(x = total_visits, y = diff, color = partner_diversity)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = richness)) + 
  facet_wrap(~treatment) + 
  labs(title = "Pollinator Niche Overlap, Pollinator Visitation and Partner Diversity", x = "Total Pollinator Visits", y = "Niche Overlap") + 
  scale_color_continuous(name = "Poillinator Partner Diversity")

```

Hypothesis 2 - floral overlap, visitation and seed output 

```{r}
# subset overlap to plants 
NicheHypTwo <- diffNichedf %>%
  filter(group == "plants") %>%
  subset(select = c(treatment, diff, partner_diversity))

# join overlap to visitation 
HypothTwo <- visitation %>%
  inner_join(NicheHypTwo) %>%
  inner_join(richness)

ggplot(HypothTwo, aes(x = total_visits, y = diff, color = partner_diversity)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = richness)) + 
  facet_wrap(~treatment) + 
  labs(title = "Plant Niche Overlap, Pollinator Visitation and Partner Diversity", x = "Total Pollinator Visits", y = "Niche Overlap") + 
  scale_color_continuous(name = "Plant Partner Diversity")
```

plot larger concepts not associated with treatments 

```{r}
richnessTrans <- richness %>%
  mutate(logrichness = log(richness, base = exp(1)))

ggplot(diffNichedf) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = overlap, y = partner_diversity, color = group))

```
